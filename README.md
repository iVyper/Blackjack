# Blackjack
Blackjack is a command-line card game implemented in Python where you play against a dealer. The game simulates a real deck of cards by shuffling and dealing cards, calculates hand totals with special handling for Aces, and follows standard Blackjack rules. As a player, you can choose to "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (end your turn). The dealer then plays by hitting until reaching a total of 17 or more. The game determines the outcome based on the final totals and offers the option to play multiple rounds.

## Features

- **Shuffled Deck:** Creates a deck with four of each card type, simulating four suits, and shuffles it for every round.

- **Accurate Hand Calculation:** Implements logic to handle Aces as either 11 or 1, ensuring your hand total is calculated correctly.

- **Interactive Gameplay:** Prompts you to hit or stand, and displays your hand, the dealerâ€™s visible card, and the dealer's actions.

- **Dealer Logic:** The dealer automatically hits until reaching at least 17, following standard Blackjack rules.

- **Multiple Rounds:** Allows you to play again after each round with the option to start a new game.

- **Clean Interface:** Clears the terminal screen between actions to keep the interface uncluttered.

## Installation
